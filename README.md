\# AI-Assistant  

## AI Assistant â€“ Sprint 1  

### Overview  
This repository contains the first sprint implementation of the **AI Assistant**, an intelligent planner and productivity tool. The system integrates an agentic AI architecture with vector search, persistent memory, and external APIs to assist users with scheduling, email, and task management.  

Sprint 1 establishes the foundational infrastructure, including backend and frontend scaffolding, authentication, database setup, and a minimal AI pipeline.
